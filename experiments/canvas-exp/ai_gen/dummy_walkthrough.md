**1. Create a Developer Key**  
   - In Canvas, generate a **Developer Key** (Admin > Developer Keys). This establishes trust between your application and the Canvas API.  
   
**2. Obtain an Access Token**  
   - Using your **Developer Key**, or simply from your Canvas profile page (**Access Token** generation in **Profile > Settings > New Access Token**), you get a **long-lived Access Token**.  
   - Keep this token secure. It’s your "password" for the Canvas API.

**3. Identify Your Course ID**  
   - Navigate to the **Course** in Canvas and note the **Course ID** from the URL. For example, if the URL is `https://institution.instructure.com/courses/12345`, then **12345** is your **Course ID**.

**4. Pick Your Base URL**  
   - Note your **Base URL**: the root of your Canvas instance (e.g., `https://institution.instructure.com`). You’ll append **API Endpoints** like `/api/v1/courses/:course_id/assignments`.

**5. Make a Test API Call in Python**  
   - Use Python’s built-in `requests` library (or `httpx`, `requests-async`, etc.).  
   - Set the **Authorization Header**: `Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>`.  
   - Make a `GET` request to a **Canvas API Endpoint**, for example, to list assignments:  
     `GET https://institution.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/<COURSE_ID>/assignments`
   
   ```python
   import requests

   BASE_URL = "https://institution.instructure.com"
   ACCESS_TOKEN = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
   COURSE_ID = "YOUR_COURSE_ID"

   headers = {
     "Authorization": f"Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}"
   }

   # Example: Get assignments
   response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/api/v1/courses/{COURSE_ID}/assignments", headers=headers)
   data = response.json()  # Canvas returns JSON
   print(data)
   ```

**6. Inspect the JSON Response**  
   - The **JSON** you get back typically includes a list of **Assignments**, each with fields like `name`, `id`, and `due_at`.  
   - Use this data to confirm the **API** works and that your **Access Token** and **Course ID** are correct.

**7. Explore Other Endpoints**  
   - Once you’ve confirmed basic connectivity, explore other **REST Endpoints** and queries (e.g., `/courses/:course_id/enrollments`, `/courses/:course_id/discussions`).
   - Review the **Canvas API Documentation** for parameters like `per_page` (for pagination), and other resources.  
   - If needed, look into **OAuth** flows or additional **Scopes** for more secure token handling.

**8. Troubleshoot**  
   - If you get errors, confirm the **Base URL**, **Access Token**, and **Course ID**.  
   - Check for **HTTP Status Codes** and **Error Messages** in the response body for clues.

This basic flow (Developer Key → Access Token → Course ID → API Call) is enough to begin experimenting with the Canvas API in Python. As you expand, you’ll integrate more endpoints, handle **Pagination**, and manage more complex workflows.
