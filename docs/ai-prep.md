To integrate your Discord bot with Canvas for posting reports and results, you'll primarily interact with Canvas's REST API. Here's a structured approach to get you started:

**1. Authentication:**
Canvas uses OAuth2 for authentication. Your bot will need to obtain an access token to interact with the API. Refer to the [Authentication using OAuth2](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/file.oauth.html) documentation for detailed instructions.

**2. Key API Endpoints:**

- **Courses:**
  Retrieve information about courses to identify where to post content.
  - *List Courses:* `GET /api/v1/courses`
  - *Get a Single Course:* `GET /api/v1/courses/:course_id`
  - [Courses API Documentation](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/courses.html)

- **Assignments:**
  Create assignments to post reports or results.
  - *Create an Assignment:* `POST /api/v1/courses/:course_id/assignments`
  - [Assignments API Documentation](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/assignments.html)

- **Submissions:**
  Submit work or results on behalf of students.
  - *Submit an Assignment:* `POST /api/v1/courses/:course_id/assignments/:assignment_id/submissions`
  - [Submissions API Documentation](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/submissions.html)

- **Grades:**
  Post grades for assignments.
  - *Grade or Comment on a Submission:* `PUT /api/v1/courses/:course_id/assignments/:assignment_id/submissions/:user_id`
  - [Submissions API Documentation](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/submissions.html)

**3. Practical Steps:**

- **Retrieve Course IDs:**
  Use the Courses endpoint to list all courses and identify the `course_id` for your target course.

- **Create Assignments:**
  With the `course_id`, use the Assignments endpoint to create new assignments where reports or results will be posted.

- **Submit Work:**
  For each student, use the Submissions endpoint to post their work or results to the corresponding assignment.

- **Post Grades:**
  After evaluating, use the same Submissions endpoint to update the submission with grades and feedback.

**4. Additional Resources:**

- **API Change Log:**
  Stay updated with the latest changes to the API.
  - [API Change Log](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/file.api_change_log.html)

- **GraphQL API:**
  For more complex queries, consider using Canvas's GraphQL API.
  - [GraphQL API Documentation](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/file.graphql.html)

**5. Testing:**

Before deploying, thoroughly test your bot's interactions with Canvas in a controlled environment to ensure reliability and accuracy.

By following this approach, your Discord bot should effectively interact with Canvas, allowing you to manage course content and submissions as intended.

Here's a Python `Canvas` service designed for FastAPI. This service uses the `httpx` library for asynchronous HTTP requests and is structured modularly, allowing for high testability.

### Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn httpx
```

### `canvas_service.py`

```python
import httpx

class CanvasService:
    def __init__(self, api_base_url: str, access_token: str):
        self.api_base_url = api_base_url
        self.headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"}

    async def get_courses(self):
        """Fetch a list of courses."""
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(f"{self.api_base_url}/courses", headers=self.headers)
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response.json()

    async def get_course(self, course_id: int):
        """Fetch details of a single course."""
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(f"{self.api_base_url}/courses/{course_id}", headers=self.headers)
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response.json()

    async def create_assignment(self, course_id: int, assignment_data: dict):
        """Create a new assignment in a course."""
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.post(
                f"{self.api_base_url}/courses/{course_id}/assignments",
                headers=self.headers,
                json=assignment_data,
            )
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response.json()

    async def submit_assignment(self, course_id: int, assignment_id: int, user_id: int, submission_data: dict):
        """Submit work for a specific assignment."""
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.post(
                f"{self.api_base_url}/courses/{course_id}/assignments/{assignment_id}/submissions/{user_id}",
                headers=self.headers,
                json=submission_data,
            )
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response.json()

    async def grade_submission(self, course_id: int, assignment_id: int, user_id: int, grade_data: dict):
        """Post grades for a submission."""
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.put(
                f"{self.api_base_url}/courses/{course_id}/assignments/{assignment_id}/submissions/{user_id}",
                headers=self.headers,
                json=grade_data,
            )
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response.json()
```

### `main.py`

This is the FastAPI app that uses the `CanvasService`.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from canvas_service import CanvasService

app = FastAPI()

# Configuration
CANVAS_API_BASE_URL = "https://canvas.instructure.com/api/v1"
CANVAS_ACCESS_TOKEN = "your-access-token"

# Dependency to get a CanvasService instance
def get_canvas_service():
    return CanvasService(api_base_url=CANVAS_API_BASE_URL, access_token=CANVAS_ACCESS_TOKEN)

@app.get("/courses")
async def list_courses(canvas_service: CanvasService = Depends(get_canvas_service)):
    return await canvas_service.get_courses()

@app.get("/courses/{course_id}")
async def get_course(course_id: int, canvas_service: CanvasService = Depends(get_canvas_service)):
    return await canvas_service.get_course(course_id)

@app.post("/courses/{course_id}/assignments")
async def create_assignment(course_id: int, assignment_data: dict, canvas_service: CanvasService = Depends(get_canvas_service)):
    return await canvas_service.create_assignment(course_id, assignment_data)

@app.post("/courses/{course_id}/assignments/{assignment_id}/submissions/{user_id}")
async def submit_assignment(course_id: int, assignment_id: int, user_id: int, submission_data: dict, canvas_service: CanvasService = Depends(get_canvas_service)):
    return await canvas_service.submit_assignment(course_id, assignment_id, user_id, submission_data)

@app.put("/courses/{course_id}/assignments/{assignment_id}/submissions/{user_id}")
async def grade_submission(course_id: int, assignment_id: int, user_id: int, grade_data: dict, canvas_service: CanvasService = Depends(get_canvas_service)):
    return await canvas_service.grade_submission(course_id, assignment_id, user_id, grade_data)
```

### Testing

The `CanvasService` class is designed to be testable by injecting a mock API base URL and token. Here's an example using `pytest` and `httpx_mock`:

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-httpx
```

```python
import pytest
from canvas_service import CanvasService

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_courses(httpx_mock):
    mock_response = [{"id": 1, "name": "Course 1"}]
    httpx_mock.add_response(
        url="https://mock-api/courses",
        json=mock_response,
    )
    service = CanvasService(api_base_url="https://mock-api", access_token="mock-token")
    courses = await service.get_courses()
    assert courses == mock_response
```

This structure keeps the code modular, testable, and extensible while aligning with FastAPI's best practices.

### Explanation of Key Directories and Files

1. **`app/`**
   - Core application code lives here.
   - Modularized into subdirectories for `routers`, `services`, and `models`.

2. **`app/main.py`**
   - The main entry point for the FastAPI app. This file includes the app instance and any startup/shutdown events.

3. **`app/routers/`**
   - Houses API route handlers for specific entities or endpoints (`courses`, `assignments`, etc.).
   - Each file corresponds to a group of related routes, following RESTful conventions.

4. **`app/services/`**
   - Contains service classes (e.g., `CanvasService`) that encapsulate logic for interacting with external APIs or performing business operations.

5. **`app/models/`**
   - Includes Pydantic models for request/response validation. These models ensure strict data type enforcement and ease of use when building APIs.

6. **`tests/`**
   - Tests are separated into unit tests (`test_canvas_service.py`) and integration tests (`test_routes.py`).
   - Use `pytest` for testing and `httpx_mock` for mocking API responses.

7. **`.env`**
   - Store sensitive configuration values (like the Canvas API token or base URL) securely.
   - Load them into your application using libraries like `python-dotenv`.

8. **`requirements.txt`**
   - Lists Python dependencies, e.g.:
     ```plaintext
     fastapi
     uvicorn
     httpx
     python-dotenv
     pytest
     pytest-httpx
     ```

9. **`README.md`**
   - Includes a project overview, setup instructions, and usage examples.
